# Random-quote-generator

In this project, I have created an app that displays random famous quotes each time a button is clicked or page is reloaded. You can display a quote from a famous athlete, politician, or historical figure:

"The only thing we have to fear is fear itself." â€” Franklin Delano Roosevelt.

I have used my knowledge of useState,Javasript,API calls and React Js to complete this project.

This project is a fun and effective way for you to practice fundamental React Js skills.
